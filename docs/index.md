<u><b>What is the humlands Mod?</u></b>
<i>Humlands is a minecraft mod for 1.15.2 created by the community. It is open source and anyone can join the development process! One thing that makes this project special is that you don't need to have loads of knowledge to contribute - you just need creativity. The mod has a sci-fi theme, but we are constantly adding features like a dimension and machines!</i>

<u><b>How do I join the development?</u></b>
<i>All you need is a github account. To sign up, head over to #join-team and type -ticket open jointeam. You will be guided through the joining process by a bot. It is recommended that you have some familiarity with minecraft modding if you want to participate coding. However, artists, modellers, brainstormers and sound designers are welcome to join too!</i>

<u><b>What are the current plans for the mod?</u></b>
<i>We don't have a specific goal to allow for more creativity. However, you can check the trello board here:  https://trello.com/b/m76L73Ku/humlands-mod</i>
